# Travelling Salesman Problem
This repository contains a collection of implementations and solutions for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) but with __legos__, which is a well-known problem in computer science that involves finding the shortest possible route that visits every point in a set of points and returns to the starting point.

## About the problem
The Travelling Salesman Problem is a classic problem in the field of computational optimization. It has many real-world applications, such as planning the delivery routes for a fleet of trucks or optimizing the placement of electronic components on a circuit board.

In general, the problem can be stated as follows: given a set of n cities and the distances between each pair of cities, find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city. The problem is NP-hard, which means that it is generally not possible to find an exact solution in polynomial time. However, there are many heuristic and approximation algorithms that can find high-quality solutions in a reasonable amount of time.

## Contents
This repository contains implementations of several common algorithms for solving the TSP, including:

- Brute force search
- Nearest neighbor algorithm
- Christofides algorithm
- 2-opt algorithm
- Simulated annealing algorithm
- Each implementation includes a brief description of the algorithm, as well as instructions for running the code and interpreting the results.

## Usage
